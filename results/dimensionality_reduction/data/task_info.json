  "task_description": "Each *feature* in a dataset functions as a single dimension. While each of the ~30,000\ndimensions measured in each cell contribute to an underlying data structure, the overall\nstructure of the data is challenging to display in few dimensions due to data sparsity\nand the [*\"curse of dimensionality\"*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality)\n(distances in high dimensional data don't distinguish data points well). Thus, we need to find\na way to [dimensionally reduce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionality_reduction)\nthe data for visualization and interpretation.\n",
